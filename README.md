#### <ins>Notes on Enhanced Safe Browsing Warning:</ins>

According to [Google](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cinstall-with-enhanced-safe-browsing),

> Extensions are considered trusted when they’re built by a developer who follows the Chrome Web Store Developer Programme Policies.

> For new developers, it generally takes a few months to become trusted. Eventually, we strive for all developers with compliant extensions to reach this status upon meeting our Developer Programme Policies.

I just created a Google developer account for this extension and thus it is possible that some people may get this warning.

However, this project follows Chrome Web Store Developer Programme Policies, and hopefully, the extension will become trusted in a few months.

If you have the error, you can simply click on `Continue to Install` to proceed. ![image](https://github.com/waihankan/De-Anza-RMP/assets/42233059/a6d78723-129e-4deb-8ac5-8642ef39b80c)
